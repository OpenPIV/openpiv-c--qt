== Note == 
Our C++ version is currently under development, but we hope to release an Alpha version of the software soon.  
You can access our pre-Alpha version here: https://github.com/OpenPIV/openpiv-c--qt.  



== Installation on Linux ==

To compile the program you will need the following libraries (make sure to get the *developer* versions):

- qt4
- fftw3
- libtiff4

In the source directory you need to run 'qmake' (or something like 'qmake-qt4', depending on how your distro works), 
followed by 'make'. 

If somebody is interested in contributing to the development, we would be more than happy to find a project.


== Installation instructions on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard) ==

1. Download and install Qt SDK from Nokia (full SDK with Qt Creator)

2. Download and install libtiff library. The steps are:

 download and unzip the tiff-4.0.0.tar.gz

./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/X11/include -I/opt/local/include' LIBS='-lGL -lGLU' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/X11/lib -L/opt/local/lib'

make

sudo make install

3. Download and install fftw3 library, follow their great instructions in INSTALL file (I had to use --disable-fortran to make it working)
